# CSE-110-Labs-SP24
Labs done during the Spring 2024 offering of CSE 110: Software Engineering at UC San Diego

This content is not meant for future use or guidance for future students of the course. Please do NOT use any lab information provided, this is meant to be a personal repository to organize the many labs that cluttered my repository. Note that while the labs may be seen here, it does not mean they are entirely correct or the only approach to solving labs; It would be best suited to follow the CSE 110 curriculum in your quarter's course offering to learn more about the field of Software Engineering rather than basing it off the code seen here.
